-- Backend located here --> https://github.com/jimmyvallejo/ChatMD-Server

-- Project built using React | Express | MongoDB | OpenAI | WhisperAI | Tailwind | MaterialUI

-- ChatMD, an artificial intelligence powered alternative to WebMD.

-- Start a chat for whatever medical issue is troubling you and ChatMD will give you a helpful response on how to help deal with it.

-- You can also pick from a list of 10,000 medical conditions pulled from the National Institute of Health API and add them to your profile. ChatMD can then take your medical history into account in its responses.

-- Other features include speech to text transcription using WhisperAi, the ability to save chats and go back to them later, and a customized search page that scrapes google to find you local doctors based on your location, which is gathered from built in browser location features and sent to a google maps API.

-- This search returns only organic results and is 100% free from google ad's or promotions.
